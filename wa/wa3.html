            <p>
                Art in Europe, also known as Western Art, covers the history of 
                visual artistic expression across the continent. This website 
                showcases art from Ancient Greek and Roman art to Modern artistic 
                movements, though some periods are omitted for brevity.

                Ancient art encompasses three main societies. The Minoan civilization, known 
                as the oldest civilization of Europe, produced artwork with a variety 
                of subject matter and exceptional craftsmanship. Classical Greek and 
                Roman art are more widely recognized. Ancient Greece is renowned for 
                its marble sculptures and architecture. Roman art, heavily influenced 
                by Greek art, often depicted their gods and the upper class.

            <h2>Medieval</h2>

            <p>
                Medieval art, often funded by the Church, is predominantly religious 
                in focus. It is characterized by a lack of realism, particularly 
                evident in the depiction of babies. This stylistic approach arose 
                because the techniques of perspective and realistic human figures 
                were lost after the fall of Rome and were not reinvented until the 
                Renaissance.

            <h2>Renaissance</h2>

            <img href="../img/renaissance.jpg" alt = "Birth of Venus">

            <p>
                The Renaissance is characterized by a renewed focus on the arts of 
                Ancient Greece and Rome, leading to significant evolution in style, 
                technique, and subject matter. This movement began in Italy, due to 
                its Roman heritage, and spread throughout Europe. The Renaissance 
                remains influential to this day.

        <section id ="Mannerism, Baroque, and Rococo">
            <h2>Mannerism, Baroque, and Rococo</h2>

            <p>
                After the Renaissance, European art split into two movements: Mannerism and Baroque. 
                Mannerism is noted for its imaginative quality and realism, almost to the point of 
                perfection. The Baroque movement, building on Renaissance principles, introduced more 
                movement, dramatic lighting, and intense drama. This evolved into the Rococo movement, 
                characterized by pastel palettes and a sense of whimsy.

            <h2>Modern Art</h2>

            <p>
                Modern art in Europe encompasses various movements: Impressionism, 
                Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Modern Art, Modernism, and 
                Late Modernism. Each movement built upon the lessons of prior movements
                to create something entirely new. For example, Impressionists are known for their 
                emphasis on light and bold brushstrokes.
